## What is Caudal?
Caudal is a platform that analyzes application logs using predictive models in real-time in order to get rich information for reliability monitoring.

## What is an Event?
Event are any data struct and is passed as a Clojure Inmutable Map.

## What is the State?
Caudal uses an application State in order to store data needed for metrics and statistics. State is global for all streamers and application. Internally, State is a Clojure Agent, so it is concurrent. State are allocated in memory, it is cleaned each time Caudal process is finished.

## What is a Listener?
A Listener is a mechanism to put Events. Caudal comes with some Listeners out of the box.

## What is a Streamer?
Streamers define a function to be applied to each event into data stream and can be composed and combinated to enrich the data stream.
